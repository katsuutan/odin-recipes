        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>My cousin works as a delivery moogle, and I told them to keep an eye out for any letters from the Warrior of Light.</p>
            <p>They got one the other day from some nice-sounding person named Dulia-Chai who lives in some place I've never heard of, kupo. Apparently, there is a new restaurant with an exquisite beef stew that she wants to take the Warrior of Light to! I told Gyohan that if he learned the same recipe, maybe we could also take the Warrior of Light out for dinner. Don't worry, I gave the letter back, kupo.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>5.5 quart Dutch Oven with lid, tongs, spatula</li>
                <li>3 pounds beef chuck, cut into large pieces</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
                <li>4 carrots peeled and cut into 1-inch thick pieces</li>
                <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
                <li>7 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon thyme, chopped</li>
                <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
                <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>3 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Generously season the beef chuck with salt and pepper. Put the seasoned beef into a bowl and toss with flour until coated.</li>
                <li>In a Dutch oven over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the beef to the Dutch oven in a single layer, but do not overcrowd the pot. Brown all sides of the meat. Remove and transfer to a plate. Add additional oil if needed and repeat until all the beef has been browned.</li>
                <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the Dutch oven. Add the carrots and onions and cook until the onions soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Return the beef to the Dutch oven and stir until well combined with the vegetables. Pour in the beef broth and add the tomato paste. Stir until the tomato paste is incorporated with the rest of the liquid. Add the bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid, and simmer for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Add the potatoes, cover, and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water. Remove the bay leaves from the stew and add the cornstarch slurry. Stir until the stew begins to thicken.</li>
            </ol>
