        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A classic, home-cooked dish for over one hundred years. Japanese Potato Salad is distinct because of its colorful addition of fresh vegetables, creamy texture, and rounded flavor. It's the <strong>ultimate crowd-pleaser.</strong></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 russet potatoes</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon kosher salt (for cooking potatoes)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup frozen or canned corn</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 Persian cucumber</li>
                <li>2 oz carrot</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt (for cucumber and carrot)</li>
                <li>2 slices Black Forest ham</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>For the Seasonings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar (unseasoned)</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>6 tablespoon Japanese mayonnaise</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h4>To Prepare the Potatoes</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1.5 inch pieces.</li>
                <li>Put the potatoes in a medium pot and add cold water to cover the potatoes by 1 inch. Add the salt for cooking the potatoes and start heating the pot over medium-high heat. To save energy and time, cover the lid, leaving it slightly ajar to avoid a boil over. <strong>Tip:</strong> Start cooking the potatoes in cold water to heat them up slowly so they cook through evenly.</li>
                <li>Once the water is boiling, remove the lid and reduce the heat to medium. Cook on a gentle boil until a skewer goes through a potato smoothly, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Put the lid back on, leaving a gap on one side, and drain the water completely from the pot. Put the pot with the potatoes back onto the stove over medium heat to let any remaining water evaporate completely, shaking the pot constantly to avoid any sticking. When there is no liquid left in the pot, remove it from the heat.</li>
                <li>Mash the potatoes lighly, leaving some small chunks for texture. Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl.</li>
                <li>While the potatoes are hot, add the rice vinegar and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside to cool.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>To Prepare the Other Ingredients</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>While you're cooking the potatoes, you can start preparing the other ingredients at the same time.</strong> Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Boil the frozen corn for 5 minutes (or follow the package instructions.)</li>
                <li>Drain the corn in a fine-mesh sieve and set aside to cool. Using the same pot, start boiling an egg from cold water over medium heat. Once boiling, set a timer for 11-12 minutes and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
                <li>When the timer goes off, shock the egg in cold water until cool and remove the shell.</li>
                <li>Slice the egg and chop it into smaller pieces. Set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>Peel the cucumber and thinly slice it.</li>
                <li>Cut the carrot in half or quarters lengthwise, and then cut them into super-thin slices.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle half of the salt (for cucumber and carrot) over the cucumber slices, knead them with your hands, and let them stand until they release their moisture, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the other half of the salt over the carrot slices, knead them with your hands, and let them stand until they release their moisture, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Put the cucumber and carrot slices in a sieve and quickly rinse under cold running water to get rid of the salt.</li>
                <li>Squeeze the cucumber and carrot slices to remove any moisture and set aside.</li>
                <li>Cut the ham into 1 inch thin strips and set aside.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>To Assemble</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add all ingredients into the bowl of mashed potatoes and mix all together.</li>
                <li>Add 2/3rd of the Japanese mayonnaise and combine well.</li>
                <li>Taste and see if you want to add more mayonnaise. Refrigerate the potato salad for <strong>30-60 minutes</strong> before serving.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>To Store</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>You can keep the leftovers in the refridgerator for up to 3-4 days.</li>
            </ol>
